### Wireframe:

While creating this website, I have been to utilize many new skills and implement them appropriately.  I created the wire frame below using Google slides and referred to it many times.  Although my website does not look exactly the same, it gave me the perfect starting point and reminded me of some ideas I would have forgotten without it.

### HTML:

I started with the html content to build out the outline of the webpage.  I separated the content into sections and divs using semantic names and even spacing. This will help browsers identify the content when using screen readers.  I also adding appropriate comments to hels myself and any other collaborators with future updates. Thinking ahead to the next step of css styling, i added classes and ids where I would need them.  Throught the design I would go back and adjust as needed.  

### CSS:

Adding the CSS styling was both fun and difficult at times.  I used what I have learned so far to style the page to suit me as the creator and meet the requirements of the requestor.  To match some of my lofty ideas, I utilized Google, W3, and MDM websites for references.  I learned a great deal creating this web page and found myself easily adjusting and debugging the code by the end.  In this css stylesheet you will find appropriate comments explaining the sections and what the code renders.  I utilized variables to optimize the code and had some fun with a fixed  section, shadowing, and a few hovers. I added a viewport and a media query to ensure my website provides a good user experience on multiple screen sizes.

### ReadMe:

Utilizing Markdown, I created an interesting, detailed account of this project.  My vision, what I learned, and the process I followed.  I hope you enjoyed this as much as I have.
