    <h3>My Story</h3>
    <p>I have always been technically minded.  From being the admin assistant/”IT girl” to Credentialing Specialist/”DBA” to working with customers in Geek Squad and lastly Auditor/”Form Designer”.  My roles have always evolved to include a technical and design aspect outside of the job description and different from my co-workers.  I have always felt that pull to do something more.  Finally I took the steps to make those “extra parts” my actual job.  I did quite a bit a research before making my decision to code.  I am now 100% sure I made the right decision as you can see from my projects.  Please take another look and feel free to contact me anytime!
